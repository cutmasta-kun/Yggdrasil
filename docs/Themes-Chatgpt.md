Why Are We Stuck with Boring Themes? OpenAI, It's Time for a Theme Revolution! ðŸš€

# OpenAI Devs, Please Listen ðŸ”¥

There's really no reason why we're still limited to only three theme options: light, dark, and systemâ€”and the system is just a variation of the previous two. 

We urgently need more themes! It really shouldn't be too challenging to implement, considering the myriad of IDE themes available out there, such as Solarized or Material Theme. 

Alternatively, why not allow users to upload their own JSON files? This way, we can craft our own themes. Just provide us with some parameters to override, and we can personalize the themes ourselves. 

Imagine having comprehensive documentation, where every parameter is clearly explained. Visual aids like images with highlighted boxes around UI elements corresponding to each parameter would be incredibly helpful.

We could even leverage ChatGPT Vision to craft themes based on whatever inspires us.

PLEASE!! LET US CUSTOMIZE OUR THEMES!
